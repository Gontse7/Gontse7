 - 👋 Hi, I’m @Gontse7
- 👀 I’m interested in getting into the technology field and learning how to code and improve my knowledge in different technology fields.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on upcoming practice projects for those who are getting started.
- 📫 How to reach me, I can be contacted via email; gontsemogana7@gmail.com and also connect on instagram @gontsemogana
- 😄 Pronouns: She, Ms
- ⚡ Fun fact: I got intersted in learning how to code and wanting to be in the technology field through having a skincare and ifestyle blog which did not work out for me.
